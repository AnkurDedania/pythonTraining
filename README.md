## NOTE: If you are unable to set up the environment to run the training material, please use the Binder link above to build a stand alone container. This will allow you to go through the notebooks. However, this should not be used for active development! Also, I would recomend forking this repo if you intent to use the Binder launch link.

# Data Science Training Exercise
This repo contains a series of jupyter notebooks with documented data model example from start to end.
